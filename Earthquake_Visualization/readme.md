# Mapping Earthquakes

## Summary  
The purpose of this project is to map earthquakes from the past 7 days and provide a visual representation of the magnitude.  
Data is retrieved from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/.  This data is updated weekly and therefore up to date within 7 days.  The size and color of the markers are representative of the magnitude of the Earthquake and is situated on the exact coordinates of the epicentre of the earthquake.

To further assist with the visual,  I've also added tectonic plates as a visual.  I've added 3 map styles: light, dark and satellite.  Additionally there are 3 layers;  All quakes in the past week, all large quakes in the past week and as mentioned, tectonic plates.

To complete this project I used Leaflet, Javascript, HTML, API's and GeoJSON.
