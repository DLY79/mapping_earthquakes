# Mapping Earthquakes

## Summary  
The purpose of this project is to map earthquakes from the past 7 days and provide a visual representation of the magnitude.  We've also added tectonic plates as a visual.  We've added 3 map styles: light, dark and satellite.  Additionally there are 3 layers.  All quakes in the past week, all large quakes in the past week and as mentioned, tectonic plates.

To complete this project we used Leaflet, Javascript, HTML, API's and GeoJSON.
